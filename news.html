	<center><h2>Website uptime management added to bulk tools</h2></center>
	<p>Quickly fixing a website that goes offline is an important job for anyone managing websites regularly. That’s why monitoring website uptime is one of the central tools at Watchful. Now it is much easier to enable and disable this feature across your entire platform.</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<center><h2>Improving the website management user experience</h2></center>
	<p>This summer, the Watchful team was careful to set aside time to rest and recharge on vacation in places like Naples (Italy), Thassos (Greece), and Vail, Colorado (USA). But we had some projects “simmering on the stove” that address the user experience of website management at Watchful. </p>

	<center><h2>Testing changes to the Joomla backup system</h2></center>
	<p>Updated 20-Sep-2021: This feature is open to all Watchful users for both Joomla and WordPress. At Watchful, we’ve been working on Joomla 4 compatibility for a while. Full support for Joomla 4 requires modernization of the Joomla backup system and we need your help testing these changes.</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<center><h2>Watchful is ready for the Joomla 4 launch on August 17</h2></center>
	<p>The long-awaited launch of Joomla 4 arrives on August 17th and we couldn’t be more excited. We’ve been preparing for this day for years and we’re ready to go! In this post, I’m going to give you a quick over of what’s happening with Watchful and Joomla 4.</p>
